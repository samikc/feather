=== Running the command ===

Run the Generator class:

java -jar org.wingsource.feather.core.Generator -s _sql-file_ -p _base-package_ 
                              -n _project-name_ -d _project-base-directory_
                              
If you want to run the project from Eclipse or Intellij Idea you need to 
provide the command line as arguments to Generator class.
